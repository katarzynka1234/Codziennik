# Day Tracker

https://katarzynka1234.github.io/Day-Tracker/

My own application to track the progress of tasks. Itâ€™s demo version. The application is programmed using JavaScript (ES6). The base function is adding tasks to be done and the ability to change their status to completed. The app contains a counter that summarizes the progress of tasks. There is also an option of sticky notes - adding notes that can be freely changed (this option is available only in the desktop version). The current date and time are also displayed. The app is adapted for mobile devices ( by Media queries).

Used technology: 
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Sass
* Java Script (ES6)
